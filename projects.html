    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <p>
      This page highlights the projects that represent my creativity and skills. Each project shows something different about what I enjoy learning and creating. Some projects are related to coding and web development. Others are focused on design, technology, or the personal interests that motivate me. I enjoy building things and seeing ideas come to life, and these projects show the progress I have made so far in my classes and personal learning.

    <p>
      One of my favorite things about working on projects is the challenge. When I try something new—whether it's writing code, building a layout, or editing a digital design—I always discover something useful that I didn’t know before. Some of the projects on this page pushed me to solve problems and figure out how to make everything work correctly. These experiences help me grow, and they give me confidence as I continue working toward my goals in technology and development.

    <p>
      Each project reflects something important about who I am. Some projects represent creativity, others represent problem-solving, and many show how much I enjoy learning new things. I included these examples so visitors can see the type of work I do and understand how I think when I build something. This page also shows some of the strengths I want to keep improving, such as design, layout planning, coding skills, and attention to detail.
