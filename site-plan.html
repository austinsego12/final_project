      <h3>Navigation and Site Map</h3>
      <p>The website includes three main pages: Home, Projects, and About Me.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Home:</strong> Introduction and overview of who I am and what I do.</li>
        <li><strong>Projects:</strong> Highlights of my web development and design work.</li>
        <li><strong>About Me:</strong> My personal story, goals, and what drives me.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Home Page -->
      <h3>Home Page</h3>
      <p>
        My home page welcomes visitors with a friendly introduction and a visually appealing layout. The goal is to help readers immediately understand who I am — a creative student who loves technology, design, and problem-solving. Visitors will learn that I enjoy coding, building computers, designing websites, and taking on challenges that help me grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        People will come to my site to get to know me as both a learner and a creator. They’ll find quick navigation to my project highlights and more personal information on the “About Me” page. I will include an image of a web developer workspace and another showing a creative desk setup to visually express my workflow.
      </p>
      <div class="image-grid">
        <img src="images/home1.jpg" alt="Web developer workspace" />
        <img src="images/home2.jpg" alt="Creative desk setup" />
      </div>

      <!-- Projects Page -->
      <h3>Projects Page</h3>
      <p>
        The Projects page will display a variety of work that reflects my growing skills in technology and design. It will include screenshots and summaries of coding projects, computer builds, and creative media pieces. Each project will include a short description explaining what I built, why I built it, and what I learned from the experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Visitors will be able to see progress from early beginner projects to more advanced web applications and game design concepts. My goal is to make this page not just a gallery, but a story of learning and experimentation. The images will feature example code on screen and a finished product presentation shot.
      </p>

      </div>

      <!-- About Me Page -->
      <h3>About Me Page</h3>
      <p>
        The About Me page will give visitors a look at my personality and values. I’ll write about where I live, what inspired me to study technology, and how my background in business and creativity helps me approach challenges differently. I’ll also share my hobbies, such as music, gaming, and building things with my hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want this page to feel warm and authentic — a place where visitors can relate to me as a real person, not just a developer. I’ll include photos that represent balance, creativity, and growth: a relaxed home office scene and a personal portrait that shows who I am outside of my projects. The page will end with a short message encouraging people to connect.
