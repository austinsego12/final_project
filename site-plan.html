      <!-- HOME PAGE CONTENT -->
      <h3>Home Page</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Austin Sego, and this website represents who I am, what I enjoy creating, and the direction I am moving toward in my education and future career. I am a student who enjoys technology, music, gaming, and building things with my hands. I’m learning how to design websites, write code, and understand how computers and applications work. This home page gives visitors a simple way to get to know me and see the different parts of my life and interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy the process of learning and improving. Whether I am working on a class project, learning a new programming concept, or experimenting with design, I like being able to see my progress as I build new skills. I want this website to show that growth. I have included examples of projects I have worked on, descriptions of what motivated them, and what I learned from creating them. The home page introduces these ideas and helps visitors understand who I am as both a student and a creator.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website is designed to share my interests and goals. I enjoy working with computers, creating digital content, designing layouts, writing code, and exploring new ideas that help me improve. I want people to see my creativity, my personality, and the things that motivate me. My goal is to continue learning skills that will help me succeed in computer science and web development. This home page gives a clear view of what matters to me, what kind of work I enjoy, and where I want to go next.
      </p>

      <!-- PROJECTS PAGE CONTENT -->
      <h3>Projects Page</h3>
      <p>
        This page highlights the projects that represent my creativity and skills. Each project shows something different about what I enjoy learning and creating. Some projects are related to coding and web development. Others are focused on design, technology, or the personal interests that motivate me. I enjoy building things and seeing ideas come to life, and these projects show the progress I have made so far in my classes and personal learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my favorite things about working on projects is the challenge. When I try something new—whether it's writing code, building a layout, or editing a digital design—I always discover something useful that I didn’t know before. Some of the projects on this page pushed me to solve problems and figure out how to make everything work correctly. These experiences help me grow, and they give me confidence as I continue working toward my goals in technology and development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each project reflects something important about who I am. Some projects represent creativity, others represent problem-solving, and many show how much I enjoy learning new things. I included these examples so visitors can see the type of work I do and understand how I think when I build something. This page also shows some of the strengths I want to keep improving, such as design, layout planning, coding skills, and attention to detail.

      <!-- ABOUT PAGE CONTENT -->
      <h3>About Me Page</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Austin Sego, and I enjoy technology, music, gaming, and learning new things. I like building computers, creating digital projects, and exploring ideas that challenge me. I am someone who enjoys working independently, figuring out how things work, and finding ways to improve my skills. I also enjoy spending time with my family and using my interests to help the people around me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I value creativity and curiosity. Whether I am designing something, writing code, or learning about hardware, I like being able to experiment and try different approaches. I enjoy problem-solving and thinking through steps until something makes sense. These interests are a big reason why I am working toward a future in computer science and web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of schoolwork, I have several hobbies that are important to me. I enjoy listening to music, watching anime, playing video games, and learning more about technology. I also enjoy improving my workspace and creating an environment that helps me focus and stay motivated. I am always learning something new and finding ways to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to continue developing skills that will help me succeed in the future. I want to create meaningful projects, learn more about programming, and eventually build things that other people can enjoy or benefit from. This page gives visitors a chance to understand who I am, what I enjoy, and what motivates me as I work toward those goals.
