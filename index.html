          Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Austin Sego, and this website represents who I am, what I enjoy creating, and the direction I am moving toward in my education and future career. I enjoy technology, music, gaming, and building things with my hands. I’m learning how to design websites, write code, and understand how computers and applications work.

          I enjoy the process of learning and improving. Whether I am working on a class project, learning a new programming concept, or experimenting with design, I like being able to see my progress as I build new skills. I want this website to show that growth and help others understand my journey as a student and creator.
