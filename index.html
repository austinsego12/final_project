    <h2>Welcome</h2>

    <p>
      Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Austin Sego, and this website represents who I am, what I enjoy creating, and the direction I am moving toward in my education and future career. I am a student who enjoys technology, music, gaming, and building things with my hands. I’m learning how to design websites, write code, and understand how computers and applications work. This home page gives visitors a simple way to get to know me and see the different parts of my life and interests.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy the process of learning and improving. Whether I am working on a class project, learning a new programming concept, or experimenting with design, I like being able to see my progress as I build new skills. I want this website to show that growth. I have included examples of projects I have worked on, descriptions of what motivated them, and what I learned from creating them. The home page introduces these ideas and helps visitors understand who I am as both a student and a creator.
    </p>

    <p>
      This website is designed to share my interests and goals. I enjoy working with computers, creating digital content, designing layouts, writing code, and exploring new ideas that help me improve. I want people to see my creativity, my personality, and the things that motivate me. My goal is to continue learning skills that will help me succeed in computer science and web development. This home page gives a clear view of what matters to me, what kind of work I enjoy, and where I want to go next.
