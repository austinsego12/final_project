    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      My name is Austin Sego, and I enjoy technology, music, gaming, and learning new things. I like building computers, creating digital projects, and exploring ideas that challenge me. I am someone who enjoys working independently, figuring out how things work, and finding ways to improve my skills. I also enjoy spending time with my family and using my interests to help the people around me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I value creativity and curiosity. Whether I am designing something, writing code, or learning about hardware, I like being able to experiment and try different approaches. I enjoy problem-solving and thinking through steps until something makes sense. These interests are a big reason why I am working toward a future in computer science and web development.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of schoolwork, I have several hobbies that are important to me. I enjoy listening to music, watching anime, playing video games, and learning more about technology. I also enjoy improving my workspace and creating an environment that helps me focus and stay motivated. I am always learning something new and finding ways to grow.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is to continue developing skills that will help me succeed in the future. I want to create meaningful projects, learn more about programming, and eventually build things that other people can enjoy or benefit from. This page gives visitors a chance to understand who I am, what I enjoy, and what motivates me as I work toward those goals.
